<p>John Doe is a mid-career landscape designer who is attending the Parsons MFADT Thesis Show ’16. He works at an architectural design studio based in New York.<a id="more"></a> Due to international clientele John has to work professionally across various countries and he frequently flies to global destinations for official meetings.<br>For several projects John spends considerable time in meetings over Skype calls with his team to brainstorm creative design solutions. </p>
<p>At the Parsons MFADT Thesis Show, held annually in May, John visits the exhibition to see student projects relevant to his interests. He comes across one of the projects that is setup against one of the walls. It is a setup of 3 ceiling mounted screens facing away from the wall towards the open exhibition space. Two of those screens face in the opposite direction and another screen in the middle faces towards him, parallel away from the wall. There is a video looping on the middle screen that encapsulates the description and the working of the project - Stickie. The concept video shows people using the tool in educational collaborative workshops, business meeting rooms and research labs. For John, it contextualizes the applications of Stickie’s interactions and how the technology performs. The presenters request John to attend one of the upcoming demos of the project that would begin in 4 minutes. While he is watching video, the other two screens show a countdown to the next demonstration. </p>
<p>The presenters perform a 5-minute choreographed demo every 15 minutes. John visits again to see the demo. At the end of the demo, John is offered to try the interface. The presenter hands him one of the phone used in the demo. John feels comfortable navigating the walkthroughs on the mobile app. The hints guide him through various features and operations of the system. He effectively navigates the user interface and tries out the system a few times. He creates notes on the phone and posts it on the TV screen, as demonstrated earlier by the presenters. The content on the phone gets posted on the TV screen wherever the phone is placed on it. He continues doing it to add a few more content. His interaction with the project finally ends with a quick chat with the presenters who share further insights about how the technology works and the potential future for such interactions. </p>
